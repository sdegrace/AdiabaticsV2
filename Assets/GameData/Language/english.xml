            <Description>The Power Limited Reciprocal Pump is the most basic of the pump varieties. Our Earth-dwelling engineers assure us that it is essentially a motorized version of a bicycle pump that operates at a steady power, while allowing the volume of gas moved to vary based on the pressure differential. The engineers did not clarify what a bicycle is or give any explanation regarding why it might need a pump. They do stress, however, that the name is in no way a reference to the sound it makes while operating.</Description>
